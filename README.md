## Description:

This project was a great chance to force myself to really understand indexing and cacheing of data with MongoDB. While most of the project is built out, it was nice to be able to get practice in storing data whilst offline then pushing it when online availability returns.

## Installation Instructions:

This app requires a number of dependencies which can be installed via running ```npm i``` in the terminal. It will work locally without anything else. To deploy it, you will need to attach your mongoDB through Atlas and Heroku, though the server.js is already staged for that.

I recommended running the program locally via ```npm run live``` to create a nodemon session.

## Usage:

To create a budget tracker able to be updated while offline and retain those entries when brought back online.
